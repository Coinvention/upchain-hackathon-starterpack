# Security Considerations

* Any Data from the blockchain is external input to the code. To assume it is not malicious, just because it is signed is deadly for any OPSEC.
* localhost is not so local: Your network is connected  to the internet. And there is your Sisters Computer or  Uncle visiting and your Phone is a computer as well.
* be aware about open connections to other systems. p2p has a red team as well.
* Data is public. Viewer discretion is advised
